This folder contains all of the individual scripts reflecting the
contents of the LFS book, with a few minor additions by myself.
(Notably: 00_prereqs.sh, which has steps specific to the Ubuntu Live
CD used by these procedures.)

These should be symlinked into separate folders for execution via
run-parts.
